### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anthony Ranieri, a Software Engineer!

I am a full stack MERN developer. I graduated Triple Ten's Software Engineering boot camp in December of 2023!

The curriculum taught me many things but in regards to the languages I learned thoroughly: HTML5, CSS3, flexbox, grid layout, BEM, Media queries, transition, JavaScript/JSX, DOM, Debugging, Git, Git/Github, Figma, Form validation, OOP, Webpack, NPM, React, React components, React Hooks, Node.js, Express.js, Database, MongoDB, Mongoose, API, Google Cloud.
