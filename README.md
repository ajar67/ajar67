### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anthony Ranieri, a Software Engineer!

I am a full stack MERN developer. I graduated Triple Ten's Software Engineering boot camp in December of 2023! Throughout my time there I helped students in the earlier Sprints to persevere throughout challenges and still act like a tutor for some students and any students needing help understanding the material. The curriculum taught me many things but in regards to the languages I learned thoroughly: HTML5, CSS3, flexbox, grid layout, BEM, Media queries, transition, JavaScript/JSX, DOM, Debugging, Git, Git/Github, Figma, Form validation, OOP, Webpack, NPM, React, React components, React Hooks, Node.js, Express.js, Database, MongoDB, Mongoose, API, Google Cloud.

With a robust skill set covering both front-end and back-end technologies, I am poised to deliver high-impact solutions as a Full Stack Software Engineer. My hands-on experience in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces, combined with a strategic mindset for optimizing server-side functionalities, empowers me to drive efficiency and innovation. I am eager to bring my adaptability and dedication to problem-solving to contribute meaningfully to your team and help elevate your projects to new heights.
